# Error-mitigated Quantum Process Tomography (EM-QPT)

# See reference: arXiv 2505.07725

Notes:

 The file "main.ipynb" refers the EM-QPT method based on simulation (qiskit).

 (1).Required packages (python) are listed in the 'requirement.txt', for running the entire code.
 
 (2).By default, the experimental readout should follows the particular order as defined in the current numerical setup. (one can define it by themself).
